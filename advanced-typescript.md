> Note: Need a better title since this is more like "intermediate" TS to get you started with complex data types

You may already know that Typescript can be a significant improvement for your Javascript developer team, but, like any new language, there is a learning curve to harness its full power of it.

In this article, I will drive you through some advanced usages of Typescript that can help you achieve those data requirements or features.

## What will be covered

We're going to explore several "advanced" building blocks that allow you to harness the power of the Typescript's type system. These types and features will enable you to enforce complex compile-time invariants.

- Generics
- Union and Intersection Types
- Typescript native utility types
- Mapped Types
- Template Literal Types
- Conditional Types

The principal value proposition of Typescript is to add some rules and order to a very loose language as Javascript leveraging the power of a compiler to act as a line of defense to catch data types related bugs. Static typing enforces contracts, which prevent certain classes of defects.

Let's dive directly into this.

## Generics

The main idea of the concept of **generics** is to allow you to create reusable pieces of code that can work with a variety of types rather than be restricted to a single one.

You can consider **generics** as code templates that you can define and reuse through your codebase. Its use will provide you with a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces what type they should use when you call it.

You can even think of the **generic** type as an argument of a function.

You should strive to use and create a **generic** function when you need things like:

- A function that can work with different data types
- Use the same data type in different places

Let's see an example use case to when and why use **generics**

Suppose you need a function that randomly returns an element from an array.

```typescript
function getRandomElement(array: number[]): number {
    let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
    return array[index];
}
```

This function accepts an `array` of type `number` and returns a `number`. All good here, right?.

Now, let's assume that you also need to get a random string from an array of strings. How would that function look?

```typescript
function getRandomElement(array: string[]): string {
    let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
    return array[index];
}
```

Precisely, the same. The only difference is the type of argument. In the first case, you used `number[]` and now `string[]` .

How can you consolidate both functions that, in fact, have the same logic?

One option is to change the type of the argument to be `any[]` but, by doing this, you will lose the type checking powers that Typescript gives you, so it is not a good solution.

The other option is to use generics, here you'll define a "type variable" that will capture the type provided at the time of calling the function, like:

```typescript
function getRandomElement<T>(array: T[]): T {
    let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
    return array[index];
}
```

> By convention, typescript community uses single uppercase letters to declare the type variable, in this case, `T`. However, you can use any word to define it.

Now, let's call this generic function with different types.

```typescript
let randomNumber = getRandomElement<number>(numbers); 


let randomString = getRandomElement<string>(string);



// More complex
interface Profile {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	email: string;
	avatar?: string;
}

let randomObject = getRandomElement<Profile>(profiles)
```

This example explicitly passes the array type that the function uses with the `<>` syntaxis.

In practice, the compiler will use type inference based on the argument, meaning that Typescript will guess the type of the generic based on the information from the argument passed to the function.

You can also use multiple generic parameters with **generics** by using different letters/names to denote each type.

```typescript
function someAwesomeFunction<T,U,V>(arg1: T, arg2:U, arg3: V): V {
}
```

## Using generic constraints to limit types

You may want to create a generic function (or interface or class) that can accept different types but only from a subset of types. In other words, you want to constrain the types that can be used for the generic.

To accomplish this constraint requirement, you'll use the keyword **extends**  that in effect allows inheriting functionally from a base type or class.

Let's use the same function as before, but let's say that you only want to accept arrays of strings and numbers.

Using generic constraints to limit types

```typescript
function getRandomElement<T extends number | string >(array: T[]): T {
    let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
    return array[index];
}

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

const randomNumber = getRandomElement(numbers)

const strings = ["one","two","three","four","five"]

const randomString = getRandomElement(strings)

const booleans = [true, false]

const randomChar = getRandomElement(booleans)
//Argument of type 'boolean[]' is not assignable to parameter of type '(string | number)[]'.
//  Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
```

## Union Types

A **union type** (or just "union" or "disjunction") is a way to define a mutually exclusive type. It is a way to create a value that can be of more than one type at a time.

This type provides information to the compiler that helps it to prove that the code is safe for all the possible data types passed to it.

This type is a perfect fit when you know all the possible states will be but do not know for sure which one will be used at a certain point. One everyday use case for this type is defining a dispatcher's actions like in the reducer pattern (like Reduce or `useReducer` in React).

Let's think in a promise, a promise can be in 3 states, `pending`, `fulfilled` or `reject` you can model these states like

```typescript
interface MyData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
}


interface FullFilled<T> {
    state: 'success';
    data: T[];
    error?: never;
}

interface Rejected {
    state: 'rejected',
    data?: never;
    error: Error
}


interface Pending {
    state: 'pending',
    data?: never;
    error?: never;
}

type RequestState<T> = FullFilled<T> | Rejected | Pending


// utility function used to update an state
function setState<T>(initial: RequestState<T>) {
    let state = initial
    function updateState(newState: RequestState<T>) {
        state = newState
    } 
    return {
        state,
        updateState
    }
}


async function doRequest() {
    const {state, updateState} = setState<MyData>({ state: 'pending'})
    try {
        const result = await fetch('/some-url')
        updateState({
            state: 'success',
            data: await result.json()
        })
    }catch(error) {
        updateState({
            state: 'rejected',
            error: error as Error
        })
    }

    return state

}

async function main() {
    const result = await doRequest()
    switch(result.state) {
        case 'pending':
            alert('Request is Pending');
            break;
        case 'success':
            alert('All good');
            break;
        case 'rejected':
            alert(`It failed: ${result.error.message}`)
            break;
    }
}
```

In this example, there are 3 interfaces: `fulfilled`, `Rejected` and `Pending` that model the 3 states of the promise, then there is a type declared named `RequestState` that states that it can be any of the 3 possible states (one at a time).

Finally, in the function `doRequest`, the request is performed, and a state is stored in a variable named `state`. This `state` is then return by the function so in effect `doRequest` return type is `Promise<RequestState<MyData>>`.

Then you can use this in another function and just `switch` over the state of the request by accessing the `state` value here. Typescript will ensure that you cover all the possible causes.

[Here is the Demo](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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-YovZFcrIRNRFFjVNBBzRBS1IU4Qsl13NMXSnM4ZzzAsi2tW06GXbIuWRLdpxzWcJmg7UN39aMAXmShX3sNFoDACtUNzYBH0GWN5nxephwAIwKOAAGs2LTY0UDMCwrBsciTxIKioBokwAEFFGQRhfF8chmz47VOIgHi1JIIjBIvIo1BMMTxMkmiAAMAElc3gFQ1GoAASfAcLnDZZ24aw4EYCAhDMltxI0rSDSEIA), go ahead and try to delete one of the switch cases. What happens?

Another common use case of an **union type** is found in the DOM itself. DOM events always happen independently of each other. So there is a finite list of possible events that can be processed:

```typescript
type Event = MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent; /* and so on */
```

One particular case of union type is **discriminated unions** (or tagged union). This specific case allows you to easily differentiate between the types with it.

Why would you want this? Because a union type can also host different types and sometimes you will want to know what type is in use, you can always use type guards for this purpose, but there is a shortcut: **discriminated unions.**

To create a **discriminated union**, you need to add a specific field to each type in the union, differentiating between each type.

One everyday use case for this type of union is to check that one piece of the data is present while another part is not. For example, A user account should have `username` and `email`  and include an `avatar` OR an `emoji.

To model this, you need to combine different types to define each case and use optional attributes along with the `never` type like this:

```typescript
type WithUsername = {
    username: string;
    email?: never
}

type WithEmail = {
    username?: never;
    email: string;
}

type WithAvatar = {
    emoji?: never;
    avatar: string
}

type WithEmoji = {
    emoji: string;
    avatar?: never
}



type User = { id: number } & (WithUsername | WithEmail) & (WithAvatar | WithEmoji)

const userWithNameAndAvatar: User = { id: 1, username: 'username', avatar: 'avatar' }

const userWithEmailAndAvatar: User = { id: 2, email: 'email', avatar: 'avatar'}

const userWithNameAndEmoji: User = { id: 3, username: 'username', emoji: 'emoji' }

const userWithEmailAndEmoji: User = { id: 4, email: 'email', emoji: 'emoji'}

const wrongUser: User = { id:5, username: 'username', email: 'email', emoji: 'emoji'}

const wrongUser2: User = { id:5, username: 'username', emoji: 'emoji', avatar: 'avatar' }
```

[Here you can find the Demo of this code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBA6glsAFgVQM4QE4DsCGBbaAXigG8AoKSqAV3W3wgC4pVgM4sBzAbgqojw44AGwD8zLBABumMgF8yZUJFgJEAUUEioxclRp1cBcVEkyMvfQKHDmrdl14Kl4aPCQBBKTmA4MO0j5KAQB7ACs4EzNMSyocb18MOzYOTnlFZTc1TXC4AL1+PFzkhx4gqHifPyjpWWcM1yg0THyoOAATCWo8ACMWuSgAMigACncUQwYoAB9VJE0bAEoh0fGvKv9Z8ZyIxcUAYxCsVgNMcYA5Bg8sdvXE5mb-XTbOqABGABpT+gJmAHJaJgjBA-l9KvcoH9wX4-lBnIdjsBvtstMJrrcEn4HnRWh1mAAmL7WET-YnCUEVTFJSHQjB-eFHE6AjAXK43HZwbEtZ54qAAZi+zOB-yFDApoQipKKEVhDMRyOyqPRHK5T1IL2YABYiaipTZxdLOZCJXB6QdGUiAO4YI6cR6q3GdACsgsmv0hooIBpsepEBuKxsNZrICJO1ttj3xDp5ztdQIYIrdIJ1Ab+JoptP+tL+AAK5EA)

To implement the above requirement, there are 4 types that work in pairs to describe what attribute should be present and how the other attribute should be.

Then a new type is created as the **union** of the other ones.

Then the new type is used, and Typescript will tell you if you are using the wrong combination of attributes.

Union types are an excellent modeling tool. There are good reasons to not use them:

- When the types are known at compile-time: You can use generics instead to provide further type safety and flexibility.
- When we need to enumerate all possibilities at runtime: Use enum instead for this).

Union types are an ergonomic way to model a finite number of mutually exclusive cases, allowing you to easily add new cases.

> By combining this feature with mapped types, you can even dynamically create types as shown in [this great Demo by Matt Pocock](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1498284926621396992?s=20&t=w7tdOotYWM4IEic_NdqGOQ) that transform a union type to another union type with a different shape.

## Intersection types

**Intersection** types can be considered the opposite of the previous **union** type.

These types create a new type by **combining**  multiple existing types. The new type will have all the properties and features of the existing ones.

```typescript
interface Student {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface WithJob {
    company: string;
}

type WorkingStudent = Student & WithJob 

const workingStudent: WorkingStudent = {
    name: 'Student',
    age: 20,
    company: 'Ccompany'
}
```

When you are intersecting type, the order doesn't matter.

In summary, an **intersection** type combines two or more types to create a new type that includes all the properties of the existing types.

## Typescript native utility types

Typescript provides you a handful of handy utility types that helps to manipulate types with ease. These utility types are, in fact, generic types.

### Partial

This utility type will enable you to create a type that will set all the properties of the exiting type to be optional.

```typescript
interface Person {
	firstName: string;:
	name: string;
	country: Country; //asumme the existance of this type
	age: number;
}


const person: Partial<Person> = { firstName: 'Matias' }

const person2: Partial<Person> = { age: 36 }
```

### Required

It is, in fact, the opposite of **Partial**, marking all the properties of a type as required.

```typescript
type Person = {
	firstName: string;:
	lastNname?: string;
	country?: Country; //asumme the existance of this type
	age?: number;
}

type RequiredPerson = Required<Person>

const person: RequiredPerson = { firstName: 'Matias', lastName: 'Hernández', age: 36, coutry: 'Chile' }

const person2: Required<Person> = { firstName: 'Person 1', lastName: 'Last Name' } // error cause' is missing age and country
```

### Readonly

This type will mark all the properties of the type argument to be not-reassignable or **read-only**

```typescript
type FuncArgs = {
	id: number;
	name: string;
}

function someFunc(args: FuncArgs ) {
	args.id = 10; 
    return args;
}

function readonlyFunc(args: Readonly<FuncArgs>) {
    args.id = 10; //Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
    return args;
}
```

### Pick

You can create a new type by "picking" properties from an existing type.

```typescript
interface Student {
    age: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    school: string;
    grade: string;
}


type Person = Pick<Student, 'age' | 'firstName' | 'lastName'>

const person: Person = {
    age: 36,
    firstName: 'Matias',
    lastName: 'Hernández'
}
```

This type allows you to create new types from a previous one by describing what properties you want as the second argument of the generic parameters.

### Omit

On the other hand, you have **Omit** that works as the opposite of **Pick** by allowing you to select what elements to remove or not consider when creating the new type.

```typescript
interface Student {
    age: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    school: string;
    grade: string;
}


type Person = Omit<Student, 'school' | 'grade'>

const person: Person = {
    age: 36,
    firstName: 'Matias',
    lastName: 'Hernández'
}
```

### Extract

This type will create a new type based on the properties present in two different types. It will **extract** from the type **T**  all properties assignable to type **U.**

Let's see an example. Here the goal is to extract all the arguments that are function types.

```typescript
type MixedArgs = string | number | (() => string) | (() => number)
type FunctionArgs = Extract<MixedArgs, Function>
```

The first argument we pass to Extract is our union type, and the second argument is the type that we will use when comparing each union member. If a member is assignable to our second argument, it will be included in the resulting type.

But, how this looks like in real life?. A good use case will be creating a filtering function.

Say you have an array of users with different types of users tagged by the `type` property, so you have a **discriminated union**  as a type.

```typescript
type Users =
  | { type: "admin"; role: string }
  | { type: "customer"; company: string }
  | { type: "affiliate"; program: string };
```

Now, you want to create a function that takes an array of `Users` and returns only those that match a specific `type`.

You can quickly get away with something like this.

```typescript
function filterUsers(users: Users[], type: Users["type"]) {
  return users.filter((item) => item.type === type);
}
```

But, there is a minor issue with this function (even tho the result will be correct at runtime), the return type of this function will always be `Users[]` even tho you know for sure that the result will be just one of the types.

Let's use `Extract` to create a better return type.

```typescript
function filterUsers<T extends Users, U extends T["type"]>(
  users: T[],
  type: U
) {
  return users.filter(
    (item): item is Extract<T, Record<"type", U>> => item.type === type
  );
}

const products: Users[] = []

const affiliates = filterUsers(products, "affiliate") //Result will be { type: "affiliate", program: string }
```

This seems a bit more complex so let's dissect it.

The function accepts two generics and uses a type predicate inside the filter function, allowing you to instruct Typescript about the specific type of the argument passed to the function when the function returns `true`.

The type that the filter function will narrow is `Extract<T, Record<"type", U>>` where `T` will be the `Users` array and `Record<"type", U>` will be an object like `{type: 'affiliate' }`

So the end result of the filter will be `{type: 'affiliate', program: string}`

### Exclude

This type works opposite to **Extract** by excluding properties already present in two different types. It excludes from `Tall fields that are assignable to` U` .

```typescript
interface UserBase {
  email: string
  image: string | null
  username: string
}

interface UserProfile {
  id: string
  email: string
  image: string | null
  isAdmin: boolean
  username: string
  reviews: string[]
}

type ProfileSpecificKeys = Exclude<keyof UserProfile, keyof UserBase>
// 'id' | 'isAdmin' | 'reviews'

type ExcludedTypes<T, U> = {
  [K in Exclude<keyof T, keyof U>]: T[K]
}

const user: ExcludedTypes<UserProfile, UserBase> = {
  id: '1234',
  isAdmin: false,
  reviews: [],
}
```

### NonNullable

This utility type will take a Type `T` and remove `null` and `undefined` from the allowed type values.

useful for instances where a type may allow for nullable values farther up a chain, but later functions have been guarded and cannot be called with null

```typescript
type NullableType = string | number | null | undefined

type NonNullableType = NonNullable<NullableType> // string | number

let numberOrString: NonNullableType = "string"

numberOrString = 10

numberOrString = undefined // error
```

It is important to note that this utility is not recursive. If you have a type with a nullable property, using the higher `NonNullable` will not affect the property. You'll need to overwrite the base type/interface to do so.

```typescript
interface UserBase {
  email: string
  image: string | null
  username: string
}


type UserBaseWithImage = NonNullable<UserBase>

const userWithImage: UserBaseWithImage = {
    email: 'email@email.com',
    image: null, // This is still nullable
    username: 'username'
}

/*
Extends and override the image property to make it non nullable
interface RequiredImage extends UserBase {
  image: NonNullable<UserBase['image']>
}
Same as 
*/
type RequiredImage = UserBase & {
  image: NonNullable<UserBase['image']>
}
```

There are a few more utility types that allow you to perform different tasks like:

- Parameters: Create a tuple type from the types used in the parameters of a function
- ReturnType: Creates a type from the return type of a function.
- String manipulation types: Uppercase, Lowercase, Capitalize, and Uncapitalize. These utility types allow you to manipulate strings transforming string types.

### Mapped types

It is time to review a feature a bit more complex. **Mapped types** allow you to take an existing model and transform its properties into a new type. This handy feature allows you to keep your types DRY.

The first step to understanding this type of [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) is to know why you want to use mapped types.

The primary use case is when you need to create a type derived from another type and remain in sync with the original one.

For example, a permissions schema defines an object that stores the user's permissions to change configurations in the app.

What happens if you add new configurations to the schema? You'll need to also update the permissions type to accommodate the new configuration on it.

In this case, would it be way better to have types that rely on each other to keep them in sync, decreasing the maintainability effort?

How could this look?

```typescript
type Configuration = {
    layout: string;
    widthraw: string;
  	deposit: string;
	sell: string;
	buy: string;
}

type Access = {
	[Property in keyof Configuration as `change${Capitalize<Property>}`]: boolean
}

/* It creates
type Access = {
	changeLayout: boolean;
	changeWidthraw: boolean;
	changeDeposit; boolean
...
...
}
*/
```

This example combines several features of Typescript, it uses:

- Indexed access types: You can access the property type by looking it up by name.
- Index signatures: Allow you to access a property even if you don't know the name of it by using the `[]` syntax (like you usually do with dynamically accessing an object property in javascript)
- The **keyof** operator: This operator returns a union of the keys of the type passed to it. In this case, the use of `keyof Configuration` resolves to `"layout" | "withdraw" | "deposit"....`
- Capitalize An utility type that transforms a string into the capitalized version of it. In this case, it changes the `Property` name: `layout` → `Layout`.

Finally, it uses [template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html) to create the name of the new property. This is a feature name as [key remapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#key-remapping-via-as)

### Template Literal Types

These types are built on the [string literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types) adding the ability dynamically creates a string.

It uses the same syntax as javascript template literals.

```typescript
type MessagesID = "welcome_msg" | "logout_msg";
type AccountStrID = "account_tittle" | "menu_title";
 
type AllLocaleIDs = `${MessagesID | AccountStrID}_id`; 
// "welcome_msg_id" | "logout_msg_id" | "account_title_id" | "menu_title_id"
```

But the real power of this type comes when you need to define a new string type by deriving its value from the information inside the type.

Let's use template literals to extract and manipulate a string literal type to, in turn, use them as properties, let's start by splitting a string to an object.

Imagine that you want to check if a semver string is in the correct format. You know the semver pattern is like `Major.Minor.Patch` so, let's build a type to check that pattern and at same time split that into an object for type checking and autocompletion.

```typescript
const version = "4.1.2"
type Version = typeof version

// We can create a type to extract the components of that string.
// We'll split across two '.' characters.

// First lest's extract the components of the string, we know that semver pattern 
// is like Mayor.Minor.Patch 
// this also use a conditional type that is explained below
// you can read it as `if Semver looks like this pattern then split into an object else error

type ExtractSemver<Semver extends string> =
    Semver extends `${infer Major}.${infer Minor}.${infer Patch}` ?
    { major: Major, minor: Minor, patch: Patch } : 
    { error: "Cannot parse semver string" }


type RequiredVersion = ExtractSemver<Version>

First step is to get the string `version` into a type by using `typeof`. Then create a type to hold the extracted semver pattern.
First step is to restrict the generic `Semver` to be an string, then at the right side a conditional type is defined (explained below) that check if the pattern match, if so, then the pattern is split into an object. If the condition fails, then an error is stored.

There are many other powerful applications of this features, for example:

There is also a few collection of utilities that help you to create even more complex types, one of them is [ts-toolbelt](https://millsp.github.io/ts-toolbelt/) that provides hundreds of utilities. [Here you can find](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1499002040168636420) a very cool use of the utilities of ts-toolbelt and string manipulation. (video by Matt Pocock)

One of the utilities used in that video and provided by ts-toolbelt is `Split`. Yes, you can construct a type that let's you split a string literal and transform that into a list of string literals to then use it as type.
Let's see how to build a simplified version of it

```typescript
// It will accept two arguments, the string to split `S` and a delimitator `D`
type Split<S extends string, D extends string> =
    string extends S ? string[] :
    S extends '' ? [] :
    S extends `${infer T}${D}${infer U}` ? [T, ...Split<U, D>] : [S];


type S1 = Split<string, ".">


type S2 = Split<"", "."> //[]


type S3 = Split<"1.2", "."> //["1","2"]

type S4 = Split<"1.2.3", "."> //["1","2","3"]

type Major = S4[0] //"1"
```

This version of `Split` works only with single characters delimitators.

First, it declares that the type will accept two "arguments", type `S` as the string to be splitted and type `D` as the delimitator, both should be strings.

Then, in the second line, it use a conditional type (explained below) that checks if the string is an string literal, if so it returns an string array.

Next line check if this string array is empty, if so, it returns an empty tuple, otherwise, in a similar way to the `ExtractSemver` example it checks if the string `S` matches the pattern and extract the pieces to then recursively re-run the `Split`. If the string don't match, meaning the delimitator is not present, then it just return the `S.`

### Conditional Types

Another powerful typescript feature is the ability to create a type based on a condition. This is, in fact, the description of a type relationship test that selects one of two possible types based on the outcome of that test.

It looks like this

```typescript
`T extends U ? X : Y `
```

That looks similar to the javascript ternary operator. You can also read this like this pseudocode.

```typescript
if(T extends U) {
	return X
}else{
	return Y
}
```

Here the letters `T`, `U`, `X`, and `Y` stand for arbitrary types.

The piece of code shown in the conditional part `T extends U` describes the type relation that is set to test.

Typescript uses this feature to create the utility types like `NonNullable`. The code for that type looks like this

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never: T;

// That can be read if a rough pseud-code like

typefunction NonNullable(T) {
	if(T === null || T === undefined) {
		return never;
	}
	return T;
}
```

This type selects the `never` branch if the type `T` is assignable to either `null` or `undefined`. Otherwise, it keeps the original type `T`.

Let's check another example use case for conditional type. Imagine that you want a way to figure it out if a string is trimmed, meaning it doesn't have empty spaces at the end of the beginning. How can that be done?

Now let's see how to implement this type. Let's check if the passed string has empty spaces at the end. You'll need a way to say:

"Check if the string contains an at the end. This can be done by using the keyword `infer`

```typescript
T extends `${infer R}`
```

The `infer` keyword is a compliment to conditional types. It cannot be used outside of an `extends` clause. `infer` allows you to define a variable within the constraint to be used or referenced later.

So in the previous code snippet, the type `infer R`  is extracting the type of the `T` generic and, since it is inside of a template literal, is constructing a new string with an empty space at the right side.

It can be read as "Is T the string with empty space at the right"?

With that, let's create the type `TrimEnd.`

```typescript
type TrimEnd<T extends string> = T extends `${infer R} ` ? TrimEnd<R> : T;

// pseudo code

typefunction TrimEnd<T extends string> {
	if(T extends `${infer R} `) {
		return TrimEnd<R>
	}
	return T;
}

// more pseudo-code

typefunction TrimEnd<T extends string> {
	if(T.endsWith(' ')) {
		return TrimEnd<R>
	}
	return T;
}
```

So, this type accepts a generic that `extends` (is constrained to) a `string` . A conditional type checks if `T` is the string with empty spaces at the right side (this is done dynamically thanks to the template literal type).

If the condition is true, it passes the type again to recursively find a string that doesn't end with a space.

You need to check if the string starts with an empty space. That type is the same but opposite of `TrimEnd`, let's call it `TrimStart`

```typescript
type TrimEnd<V extends string> = V extends ` ${infer R}` ? TrimEnd<R> : V;
```

And with these two types, you can finally create the T'rimmed' type required.

```typescript
type TrimStart<V extends string> = V extends ` ${infer R}` ? TrimStart<R> : V;
type TrimEnd<V extends string> = V extends ` ${infer R}` ? TrimEnd<R> : V;
type Trimmed<V extends string> = TrimStart<TrimEnd<V>>;


const password = "this is the password with empty spaces at the end and begin"


function collectPassword<T extends string>(str: Trimmed<T>) {
    return str;
}

collectPassword("this is the password")

collectPassword(" invalid password ") // This triggers an error
```

This type uses a combination of powerful typescript features: Template Literal Types and Conditional Types. You can mix and match as many Typescript features as you need and want to create your own utilities and complex types.

Typescript is a fully-fledged language that is not just to add some types into the loosy Javascript but can help you model complex data requirements and avoid various kinds of bugs.
